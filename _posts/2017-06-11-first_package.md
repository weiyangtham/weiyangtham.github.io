Well this is pretty darn exciting. I made my first package and first custom theme! Check it out [here](https://github.com/weiyangtham/econothemes)!

You can install it as follows: 


{% highlight r %}
devtools::install_github("weiyangtham/econothemes")
{% endhighlight %}

I'll do a more in-depth post about the process, complete with acknowledgements for all the people whose Github accounts I raided for code, but for now I just really wanted to share this.
