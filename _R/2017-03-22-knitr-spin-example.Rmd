I wrote up a [quick example](https://github.com/weiyangtham/weiyangtham.github.io/blob/master/files/spin_example.R) on how to use `spin` from the `knitr` package to compile an R script, as opposed to an R Markdown file, into a report. [Dean Attali's](http://deanattali.com/2015/03/24/knitrs-best-hidden-gem-spin/) [posts](http://deanattali.com/blog/ezknitr-package/) were what got me started on `spin`, so I'm really just drawing on much of his material. Also, his `ezknitr` package is invaluable for dealing with `knitr` working directory quirks. 

I usually use `spin` at the "analysis" stage - after data cleaning but before writing the paper. I don't like using R Markdown at this point yet because there's still a lot of coding and iteration going on, which makes it tricky to navigate between code chunks. But I still want to be able to produce "reports" that I can refer back to or show to advisors/colleagues, and `spin` is precisely for that middle ground. 

Dean has an example script on his first post about `spin` but I wanted to write up a really simple one that gets at the essence of how `spin` works. The accompanying `spin_example.html` shows you what the output should look like. You'll need to install the `tidyverse` and `gapminder` packages but other than that the script should be self-contained.
