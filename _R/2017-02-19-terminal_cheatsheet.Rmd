```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

Some terminal commands that I use repeatedly but not enough that I don't have to keep looking them up. Credit goes to friend and fellow OSU grad student Joseph Rossetti for many of these. 

#### SSH login
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
ssh -l username name_of_remote_server
```

#### Transfer files between remote and local machines
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# From me to remote server
scp my/directory/datafile.txt username@remote_server:/remote/directory

# From remote server to em
scp username@remote_server:/remote/directory/datafilet.txt my/directory/
```

### Screen
Screen lets you open multiple windows in Unix. It also lets you run processes after you've logged off a remote server or lost connection for some reason. 

#### Start new session
```{bash}
screen -S name_of_new_window
```
You don't necessarily have to name a session but I think it's helpful to. 

#### List current screen sessions
```{bash}
screen -ls
```

#### Go to a particular screen session
```{bash}
screen -r name_of_session
```

#### Detach from a session
```{bash}
ctrl + a + d
```


#### Exit screen session
```{bash}
# While in the session
exit

# While detached from the session (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1509677/kill-detached-screen-session)
screen -X -S [session # you want to kill] quit
```
