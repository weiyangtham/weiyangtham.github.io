```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 9)
```

Well this is pretty darn exciting. I made my first package and first custom theme! 

You can install it as follows: 

```{r}
devtools::install_github("weiyangtham/econothemes")
```

I'll do a more in-depth post about the process, complete with acknowledgements for all the people whose Github accounts I raided for code, but this is it for now!
