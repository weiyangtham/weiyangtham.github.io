Hi! I'm Wei Yang Tham (first name: Wei Yang) and I'm pursuing my Ph.D in Economics at The Ohio State University. My research interests are in labor economics and the economics of science. My ongoing projects study the effect of informal interactions on knowledge diffusion and the effect of funding fluctuations on innovation in science. I'm also an R enthusiast. 

If you'd like to connect, I'm active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/wytham88) or you can reach me by email at weiyang.tham@gmail.com
